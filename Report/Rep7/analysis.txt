ysis and Discussion (2 page maximum). In particular, answer these questions 
1) What is the effect of time delay in your control system? 

The effect of time delay would be that robot reacts to the environment data that belongs to a previous point in time. This could result in robot not turning quickly
as soon as it finds a gap, the robot not being able to stabilize its direction among the sides, and the robot hitting the wall before knowing that it has to stop.

2) What sensors would you need to develop a more effective passing strategy? 

IR sensors are more suitable. The most important reason is that IR sensors work well regardless of the angle of the sensor with respective to the object.
In this case, since the robot could have any angle to the surrounding walls, IR sensors are the better options compared to ping. Also, IR sensors can provide
distance information with lower latency.

3) If you hit the wall a lot, how could you have changed the design to be more effective? If your robot can 
travel 3 milestones without hitting a wall, you can skip this question. 

Skip, we pass 3 milestones without hitting a wall.

4) Briefly explain how odometry could be used in your robot (we discussed it in class). If you used it, how 
well did it work and how could it be improved? If you didn’t use it, why didn’t you use it? 

Odometry can be used to estimate the position and orientation of the robot based on its current position. We decided to not use odometry because of two reasons:
first, odometry requires accurate information of speed and angular velocity. Since we were not using any type of speed sensors, estimating velocity would not
result in accurate measurements. Second, for the odometry to be effective, an accurate information of the map and
environment is required. The prediction of the robot state is not going to be useful if information about the map is not available.
