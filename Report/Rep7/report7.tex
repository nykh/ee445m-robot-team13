\maketitle

\section{Objective} This is the final robotic project. We build a robot and compete in the final race with other robots.

\section{Hardware Design}

\section{Software Design}

\lstset{language=C, style=MyCStyle}

\paragraph{(a) Low-level device drivers for the motor interfaces (header and code files) \\}
{
See below
\lstinputlisting{code/motor.h}
\lstinputlisting{code/motor.c}
}

\paragraph{(b) Low-level device drivers for the sensor interfaces (header and code files) \\}
{
IR sensor code is basically the same as Lab.\ 6, but with filter removed. A calibration function is added
that applies linear interpolation to find out the real distance.

\lstinputlisting{code/ir_sensor.h}
\lstinputlisting{code/ir_sensor.c}

The Ping))) sensor code is similar to Lab.\ 6 but now a median filter is added to stabilize the value. Also
the number of sensor is optimized to 2.

\lstinputlisting{code/ping.h}
\lstinputlisting{code/ping.c}

}

\paragraph{(c) High-level competition algorithm \\}
{
Our final competing algorithm employs a PI controller and a finite state machine.

\lstinputlisting{code/algorithm.c}
}

\paragraph{(d) Final data flow graph \\}
See Figure-\ref{df}

\section{Measurement}

\section{Analysis}
\paragraph{(1) What is the effect of time delay in your control system? }
Time delay such as those introduced by CAN channel, latency for sensor or delay of digital filter all adds latency
to the robot's response to change in positions.

\paragraph{(2) What sensors would you need to develop a more effective passing strategy? }
I propose we have more reliable long-range IR sensors to replace the unreliable Ping))) sensors.

\paragraph{(3) If you hit the wall a lot, how could you have changed the design to be more effective? If your robot can 
travel 3 milestones without hitting a wall, you can skip this question. }

\paragraph{(4) Briefly explain how odometry could be used in your robot (we discussed it in class). If you used it, how 
well did it work and how could it be improved? If you didn’t use it, why didn’t you use it?}

\item[ZY]	1. never give up trying 2. working hard	;	1. little background in EE
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Failure and Success in Communication}
We started out early with logistics and use new internet technology to improve our communication, for example
code repository and smartphone apps. The only thing preventing us from better communicating is the language barrier
because we all speak English as a second language, but despite this we are able to work beyond the nationality and
function well. Our success in communication is that we have been able to meet punctually and we have a strong
leadership and clear job assignment that makes everybody engaged and working.
